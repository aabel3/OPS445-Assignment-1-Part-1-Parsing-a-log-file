# OPS445 Assignment 1 – Part 1

Welcome to OPS445 Assignment 1 – Part 1!

In this assignment, you will apply your foundational Python skills to build more structured programs. The focus is on functions, modularity, and system interaction, preparing you for larger projects later in the course.

📚 Assignment Objectives:
+ Reinforce the use of functions to organize code into reusable blocks
+ Practice importing functions from other files
+ Work with arguments and return values to make functions flexible
+ Apply conditional logic and loops in structured programs
+ Run and capture system commands from Python scripts
+ Document your work with clear outputs and logs for grading

📂 Assignment Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this assignment:
+ a1p1.py – Main assignment script
+ Supporting function files (e.g., functions.py)
+ Test scripts for validating functionality

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
+ Break down problems into smaller functions—each should do one thing well.
+ Use meaningful names for functions and variables to improve readability.
+ Test each function independently before integrating them into the main script.
+ Compare Python’s ability to run system commands with Bash scripting to understand differences.
+ Keep your code modular and well-commented for easier debugging and grading.
